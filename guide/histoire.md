Pale: bread, crackers

Dark: caramel, nutty, toffee, chocolate, coffee

## American (light) lagers

Amber: Dosickeys Amber. More malt, caramel, toast.

Dark: Shiner Bock. Caramel coloring, it's like a International pale lager.

## Cream ale

Not a lager but flavor similar to American lagers. Ale yeasts, not a lot of fermentation flavors.

## Malty European lagers

### Munich Helles

Germany. Helles=light/pale. Most popular beer in Bavaria. Glass=steins. 

### Kellerbier

Keller=seller. Just finished fermenting, so young beer, normally unfiltered. Basically an unfiltered version of Munich Helles.  

### Märzen and Festbier

Bavaria. Oktoberfest. ~1800, Prince Ludwig was getting married and invited his people to celebrate his marriage (it was in October). Märzen=March. Cellared during the warmer months of the year to be enjoyed in October. If you see a pale colored märzen it will be called a Festbier.

### Vienna lager

~1825. Less malty, more pale, more bitter than Märzen. Vienna instead of Bavaria. Ironically, it is more popular in the US or Mexico.

### Munich Dunkel

Dunkel=Dark. Dark, toasty, pretzel bread crust, malty. Dark version of Munich Helles. Historically old beer.

### Schwarzbier

Schwarz=Black. Darker version of Munich Dunkel. Additional light chocolate and toasty flavors. 

### Czech malty [amber, dark] lagers 

Rare beers. Malty, bitter, spicy hop aroma.

## Bock beers

Einbeck city. Stronger than regular beers, at least 6%. Going to 14%.

### Helles bock or Mai bock

Higher strength version of a regular Dunkel's Bock. Most popular Bock. Salvator Brewery invented it. Also named A.T.O.R.

### Eisbock

Eis=Ice. Doppelbock that has been frozen to concentrate the flavor. Freezing a beer separates the hops from the water so you can remove the water and get a highly favored beer and more intense alcohol. Can be 14%. Dark fruit or dried fruit notes like raisins, prunes or figs.

## Hoppy lagers

### Czech Premium Pale Lager or Bohemian Pilsner

Called Bohemian Pilsner but it changed because Pilsner is a German word and not a Czech word. And, in Czech Republic Pilsner is a brand, it's not a style of beer. The only beer that carries the name of Pilsner in the CR is the Pilsner Urqell. 1842. Brewed with very soft water from the town of Pilsen: this allowed a higher quality bitterest that is stronger but softer. One of the first industrial affordable pale malts. 

### Czech Pale Lager

Lighter version of the Czech premium pale lager: lower in malt flavor, lower in body, lower in alcohol. 

### German Pils

Germans copying the Czech Pilsner style. 

### German Leichbier

Light beer.

### German Helles Exportbier

Between German Pils and Munich Helles. More bitter than a Helles but more body than a Pils. Come from the city of Dortmund and the style was originally called Dortmunder Export.

### Kölsch

Ale version of German Pils. Not a lot of fermentation. German city of Cologne. The German name of that city is Koln. Kölsch=of Koln. Served in the 200mL round long glasses. Very fun in the bars.

### Pre-Prohibition lager

Historical style, does not exist anymore It's the link between German Pils and American Lagers. It's the beer that the German immigrants made to recreate a German Pils with the American ingredients. Prohibition because of the economical problems that destroyed the beer enterprise. Before the prohibition there were a lot of styles, flavors, types... after, after the War, there was 1 flavor, 1 style, American Lager. After the War the mentality was: I want the same flavor anywhere I go. People passed more time at home, less time in the bars, so the American Lager did not have a lot of different flavors. 

# Non-Roasty Malty Ales

## British Strong Ale

High alcohol, malty, but less than Barley Wine beers. 6% to 8%. 

## Old Ale

Similar strength that the British Strong Ale, aged character, not very popular so hard to know the real flavor between those 5:

### Scottish [light, heavy, export] 

Different levels of alcohol, so different levels of intensity. Light: 2.5% to 3%, Heavy, 3% to 4%, Export 4% to 6%. Light and Heavy are hard to find outside of Scotland. Most common beer of the style is: Belheven Scottish ale (it is an Export).

## Baltic Porter

Brewed around the Baltic sea. Sweeden, Russia and Polland. Made as a lager because of the countries temperatures. 6% to 10%.

## Pre-Prohibition Porter

Historical style. American version of the English Porter style. Around the time of the Revolutionary war in the US. ~1750 when Porter was extremely popular, ingredients were very rare and there were not a variety, so to make new styles the solution was to make beers of different strengths (different amounts of the same ingredients).

## Stout

Stronger version of Porter. 

### Irish Stout

### Sweet Stout and Oatmeal Stout

## British Hoppy Ales

### English IPA

Unique American innovation. Beer: Anchor Steam beer. California, ~1850 to ~1925, all the steam beer breweries died and Anchor was the only one left. Originally named Steam Beer.
